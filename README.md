# trigrams
Day 3 Codefellows 401 Python project.

The trigrams module was designed using test driven development. It is used to mutate text into new and surreal forms.

Trigrams.py can be run from the command line with a txt file and an integer to specify the length of output text.

The example_output.txt file shows an example for the output when n = 500.
